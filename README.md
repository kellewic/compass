# Splunk Welcome App

This application shows how the Splunk Data-to-Everything&trade; platform helps ITOps, Security, and DevOps teams bring data to every question, decision, and action. The ITOps, Security, and DevOps pillars are broken down into six main activities: collect, investigate, monitor, triage, analyze, and automate; mirroring a common maturity journey across teams.

## Dashboards

There's a lot of information on [Splunk's website](https://splunk.com) and this app presents much of it on the following dashboards.

### Discover

The **Discover** dashboard shows you Splunk's capabilities within the context of ITOps, Security, and DevOps.
