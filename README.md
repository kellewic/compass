# Compass

Compass shows how the Splunk Data-to-Everything&trade; platform helps ITOps, Security, and DevOps teams bring data to every question, decision, and action. The ITOps, Security, and DevOps pillars are broken down into six main activities: collect, investigate, monitor, triage, analyze, and automate; mirroring a common maturity journey across teams.

## Dashboards

There's a lot of information on [Splunk's website](https://splunk.com) and this app presents much of it on the following dashboards.

### Discover

The **Discover** dashboard shows you Splunk's capabilities within the context of ITOps, Security, and DevOps. Each link within the table provides additional information to aid you in your data maturity journey.

### Learn More

The **Learn More** dashboard provides links to main sections of Splunk's website. These links will help you become an expert in your Splunk environment, the data you collect, and how it can help your business achieve its goals.
